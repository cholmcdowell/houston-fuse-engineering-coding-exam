Versent Take-Home-Exam Notes:

    Design:

    I approached this assignment by familiarizing myself with Docker Desktop, React, and JS.
    I utilized useState and useEffect hook to manage component state and handle API requests.
    Fetching data was through the backend and filtering from the client-side. 

    Workflow:

        ~Initial setup~
        1. Fork master
        2. Add Tate Walker (GitHub: @TateWalker)
        3. Install neccessary libraries and tools
        4. Follow Getting Started

        TASK I
        1. Docker Desktop for backend setup and run locally
        2. TeamMember collection and data display
            2.1 Used Dev Tools in browser to find mapping issues
        3. Added 1 second to loading time to illustrate functionality
            3.1 Would handle with more care, but not for this specific small demo
        4. Error handling on loading or requests
            4.1 For testing, stopped backend through Docker Desktop -> refreshed page
        
        TASK II
        1. Search bar to take user text
        2. nameFilter React state -> keeps React in charge of value (rather than DOM)
        3. setNameFilter updates state -> React re-renders -> list filters live
        
        TASK III
        1. Similar to TASK II, but a drop down menu for distinct department values
        2. User chooses from DEPARTMENTS[] list of values
            2.1 frontend\src\types\team.ts

    Improvements:

        - Styling would be more presentable.
        - isMounted() implemented in the loading functionality to avoid setting state on an 
            unmounted component, if user navigates away from page. 
        - Emails of members would be a hotlink to directly email the individual.
